## Start AWS cluster

Once you have [configured your cluster](https://github.com/shenjean/cloud-classroom/blob/main/PW/configure.MD), you can turn it on by clicking on the round power button corresponding to your instance name.
It may take up to 15 minutes for an AWS cluster to be ready. Wait until the "active" state is indicated in the status indicator at the end of the "Node Status" bar.

Once the cluster is up, the "Node Status" bar will turn green up to the first tick indicating that the login node is ready for use. 

### Get IP address of master node
To get the IP address of the master node, click on the "i" button next to the "gear" (the configure button); which opens the "Status" window that displays the IP address to be used to connect to the Master node. Click on the link next to the "Master node" and copy the IP address, "Cancel" the small window, and close the "Status" window.
